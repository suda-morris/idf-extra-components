# ESP Serial Slave Link

## Overview

Espressif provides several chips that can work as slaves. These slave devices rely on some common buses, and have their own communication protocols over those buses. This `esp_serial_slave_link` component is designed for the master to communicate with ESP slave devices through those protocols over the bus drivers.
